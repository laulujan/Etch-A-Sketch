# Etch-A-Sketch
The Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch (DOM manipulation project)

## Assignment
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
     - Create the divs using JavaScript
2.  Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
3. Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.
